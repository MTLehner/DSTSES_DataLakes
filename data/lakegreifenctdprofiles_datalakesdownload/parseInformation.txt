Datalakes Parse Parameters 
The table below maps the physical parameter to its given axis. 
 
Axis | Parameter | NetCDF Parameter Name | Unit | Description 
x | Time | time | seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 | Time 
y | Depth | pressure | m | Depth is the vertical distance below the surface. 
z1 | Conductivity | conductivity | mS/cm | Electrical conductivity (EC) estimates the amount of total dissolved salts (TDS), or the total amount of dissolved ions in the water. 
z2 | Conductivity (20degC) | conductivity_20 | mS/cm | Electrical conductivity (EC) estimates the amount of total dissolved salts (TDS), or the total amount of dissolved ions in the water. This is normalized to 20 degC. 
z3 | Oxygen Saturation | o2_percent | % | Fractional saturation is the ratio of some measure of concentration to the saturated value of the same quantity. 
z4 | Dissolved Oxygen | o2_ppm | mg/L | Dissolved oxygen refers to the level of free, non-compound oxygen present in water or other liquids. 
z5 | pH | ph |  | A figure expressing the acidity or alkalinity of a solution on a logarithmic scale on which 7 is neutral, lower values are more acid and higher values more alkaline. The pH is equal to −log10 c, where c is the hydrogen ion concentration in moles per litre. 
z6 | Chlorophyll A | chla | null | 'Mass concentration' means mass per unit volume and is used in the construction mass_concentration_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as 'nitrogen' or a phrase such as 'nox_expressed_as_nitrogen'. Chlorophylls are the green pigments found in most plants, algae and cyanobacteria; their presence is essential for photosynthesis to take place. There are several different forms of chlorophyll that occur naturally. All contain a chlorin ring (chemical formula C20H16N4) which gives the green pigment and a side chain whose structure varies. The naturally occurring forms of chlorophyll contain between 35 and 55 carbon atoms. Chlorophyll-a is the most commonly occurring form of natural chlorophyll. The chemical formula of chlorophyll-a is C55H72O5N4Mg. 
z7 | Turbidity | turb | NTU | Turbidity is a dimensionless quantity which is expressed in NTU (Nephelometric Turbidity Units). Turbidity expressed in NTU is the proportion of white light scattered back to a transceiver by the particulate load in a body of water, represented on an arbitrary scale referenced against measurements made in the laboratory on aqueous suspensions of formazine beads. 
z8 | Phycocyanin | phycocyanin | null | Phycocyanin is a pigment-protein complex from the light-harvesting phycobiliprotein family, along with allophycocyanin and phycoerythrin. It is an accessory pigment to chlorophyll.  
z9 | PAR | par | null | Designates the spectral range (wave band) of solar radiation from 400 to 700 nanometers that photosynthetic organisms are able to use in the process of photosynthesis. 
z | Water temperature | temperature | °C | Lake water temperature is the in situ temperature of the lake water. To specify the depth at which the temperature applies use a vertical coordinate variable or scalar coordinate variable. There are standard names for lake_surface_temperature, lake_surface_skin_temperature, lake_surface_subskin_temperature and lake_surface_foundation_temperature which can be used to describe data located at the specified surfaces.
