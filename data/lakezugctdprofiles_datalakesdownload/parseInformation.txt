Datalakes Parse Parameters 
The table below maps the physical parameter to its given axis. 
 
Axis | Parameter | NetCDF Parameter Name | Unit | Description 
M | Time | time | seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 | Time 
y | Water Pressure | Press | dbar | "Water pressure" is the pressure that exists in the medium  water. It includes the pressure due to overlying water, air and any other medium that may be present.  
x1 | Conductivity | Cond | mS/cm | Electrical conductivity (EC) estimates the amount of total dissolved salts (TDS), or the total amount of dissolved ions in the water. 
x2 | Chlorophyll A | Chl_A | null | 'Mass concentration' means mass per unit volume and is used in the construction mass_concentration_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as 'nitrogen' or a phrase such as 'nox_expressed_as_nitrogen'. Chlorophylls are the green pigments found in most plants, algae and cyanobacteria; their presence is essential for photosynthesis to take place. There are several different forms of chlorophyll that occur naturally. All contain a chlorin ring (chemical formula C20H16N4) which gives the green pigment and a side chain whose structure varies. The naturally occurring forms of chlorophyll contain between 35 and 55 carbon atoms. Chlorophyll-a is the most commonly occurring form of natural chlorophyll. The chemical formula of chlorophyll-a is C55H72O5N4Mg. 
x3 | Turbidity | Turb | FTU | Turbidity is a dimensionless quantity which is expressed in NTU (Nephelometric Turbidity Units). Turbidity expressed in NTU is the proportion of white light scattered back to a transceiver by the particulate load in a body of water, represented on an arbitrary scale referenced against measurements made in the laboratory on aqueous suspensions of formazine beads. 
x4 | pH | pH |  | A figure expressing the acidity or alkalinity of a solution on a logarithmic scale on which 7 is neutral, lower values are more acid and higher values more alkaline. The pH is equal to −log10 c, where c is the hydrogen ion concentration in moles per litre. 
x5 | Oxygen Saturation | sat | % | Fractional saturation is the ratio of some measure of concentration to the saturated value of the same quantity. 
x6 | Dissolved Oxygen | DO_mg | mg/l | Dissolved oxygen refers to the level of free, non-compound oxygen present in water or other liquids. 
x7 | Salinity | SALIN | PSU | Salinity is the saltiness or amount of salt dissolved in a body of water, called saline water. 
x8 | Binary Error Mask | time_qual | 0 | data_binary_mask has 1 where condition X is met, 0 elsewhere. 0 = high quality, 1 = low quality.  
x9 | Binary Error Mask | Press_qual | 0 | data_binary_mask has 1 where condition X is met, 0 elsewhere. 0 = high quality, 1 = low quality.  
x10 | Binary Error Mask | Temp_qual | 0 | data_binary_mask has 1 where condition X is met, 0 elsewhere. 0 = high quality, 1 = low quality.  
x11 | Binary Error Mask | Cond_qual | 0 | data_binary_mask has 1 where condition X is met, 0 elsewhere. 0 = high quality, 1 = low quality.  
x12 | Binary Error Mask | Chl_A_qual | 0 | data_binary_mask has 1 where condition X is met, 0 elsewhere. 0 = high quality, 1 = low quality.  
x13 | Binary Error Mask | Turb_qual | 0 | data_binary_mask has 1 where condition X is met, 0 elsewhere. 0 = high quality, 1 = low quality.  
x14 | Binary Error Mask | pH_qual | 0 | data_binary_mask has 1 where condition X is met, 0 elsewhere. 0 = high quality, 1 = low quality.  
x15 | Binary Error Mask | sat_qual | 0 | data_binary_mask has 1 where condition X is met, 0 elsewhere. 0 = high quality, 1 = low quality.  
x16 | Binary Error Mask | DO_mg_qual | 0 | data_binary_mask has 1 where condition X is met, 0 elsewhere. 0 = high quality, 1 = low quality.  
x17 | Binary Error Mask | SALIN_qual | 0 | data_binary_mask has 1 where condition X is met, 0 elsewhere. 0 = high quality, 1 = low quality.  
x | Water temperature | Temp | °C | Lake water temperature is the in situ temperature of the lake water. To specify the depth at which the temperature applies use a vertical coordinate variable or scalar coordinate variable. There are standard names for lake_surface_temperature, lake_surface_skin_temperature, lake_surface_subskin_temperature and lake_surface_foundation_temperature which can be used to describe data located at the specified surfaces.
